# Library CRUD Project

This project is a simple library management system that allows users to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for books and authors. It is built with Node.js, React, and PostgreSQL. It serves me as a playground for studying web development and exploring the accompanying infrastructure elements, such as servers, databases, APIs, and deployment processes.
